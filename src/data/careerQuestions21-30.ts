Before the Interview:

Delaying Tactics (Early Interview Stages):

9. "Could you share the budgeted range for this position?"
10. "I'm flexible and open to discussing fair compensation for the value I'll bring."

Direct Response Approaches:
11. Provide a range rather than a specific number: "Based on my experience and the market, I'm looking in the range of $X to $Y."

Following Up:

16. Request information about the entire package: "I'd like to consider the complete compensation package, including benefits and growth opportunities."
17. Emphasize flexibility: "While this is my target range, I'm open to discussing the complete compensation package."

Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

21. Being unprepared with specific numbers and research
